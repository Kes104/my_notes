## topic : Introduction

### Abstract
This chapter provides a brief overview of the cloud computing phenomenon by presenting its vision, discussing its core features, and tracking the technological developments that have made it
possible. The chapter also introduces some key cloud computing technologies as well as some insights into development of cloud computing environments.

### definition as per NIST
Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

### Service methods
1. *PaaS* - Platform as a Service
2. *SaaS* - Software as a Service
3. *IaaS* - Infrastructure as a Service

### Deployment models
 - *Public Cloud* - The infrastructure is made available to the general public or a large industry group and is owned by an organization selling cloud services.
 - *Private Cloud* - The infrastructure is operated solely for an organization. It may be managed by the organization or a third party and may exist on or off the premises of the organization.
 - *Community Cloud* - The infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that has shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be managed by the organizations or a third party and may exist on premises or off premises.
 - *Hybrid Cloud* - The infrastructure is a composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds).

### Obstacles in Cloud-Computing
- Availability of service
- Vendor lock-in
- Data confidentiality and audit ability
- Data transfer bottlenecks
- Performance unpredictable
- Elasticity

A number of activities are necessary to support the three delivery models; they include:
1. **Service management and provisioning**, including virtualization, service provisioning, call center, operations management, systems management, QoS management, billing and accounting, asset management, SLA management, technical support, and backups.
2. **Security management**, including ID and authentication, certification and accreditation, intrusion prevention, intrusion detection, virus protection, cryptography, physical security, incident response, access control, audit and trails, and firewalls.
3. **Customer services** such as customer assistance and online help, subscriptions, business intelligence, reporting, customer preferences, and personalisation.
4. **Integration services**, including data management and development.

### Challenges in CC
* Security issues.
* DoS {Denial of Service} attack chances.
* Resource management in cloud.
